First approach:
- load up the dataset and create the predictive model
- create any visualizations you find useful 
- use any supervised learning model you prefer 

Second approach:
- use the notebook as a guide 
- complete the tasks in the notebook
- this one only uses predictive tree-based models (as opposed to SVMs or Logistic Regression)

Third approach:
- just follow along with the solutions videos.


Let's try First Approach! This will be like doing a kaggle competiton.
